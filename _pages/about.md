SpecMatrix is an iOS application designed to provide an innovative solution for users to monitor their iPhone. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools to monitor and analyze your device's performance, network, and hardware capabilities, all in one intuitive interface. By providing real-time insights and detailed metrics, SpecMatrix empowers users to better understand and manage their devices.

## My Mission

My personal mission is to provide users with the ability to monitor their iPhone and resource usage. I made SpecMatrix as a project for a class I take and plan to expand and improve it further.
